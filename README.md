# Hard Rock Solution - Song Lyric App

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for song lyrics using the Hard Rock API. Users can enter an artist or song name, and the app will display a list of matching songs along with their respective artists. Additionally, users can click on a "Get Lyrics" button next to each song to fetch and display the lyrics for that song.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript

## File Structure:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page, including the layout, navigation bar, search bar, and placeholders for displaying search results and song lyrics.
- `style.css`: Contains custom CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the app.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript code to handle user interactions, fetch data from the Hard Rock API, and display search results and song lyrics dynamically.

## Explanation of Files:

### HTML (`index.html`):

- Defines the basic structure of the web page using HTML tags.
- Includes Bootstrap CSS for styling and responsiveness.
- Links the custom CSS file (`style.css`) and JavaScript file (`script.js`).
- Contains a navigation bar with a logo and menu items.
- Provides a search bar for users to enter artist or song names.
- Includes placeholders for displaying search results and song lyrics.

### CSS (`style.css`):

- Defines custom styles to enhance the appearance of the app.
- Sets background colors, font styles, button styles, etc.
- Provides responsive design for different screen sizes.

### JavaScript (`script.js`):

- Defines the base URL for making API requests to the Hard Rock API.
- Handles user interactions such as clicking the search button and "Get Lyrics" buttons.
- Fetches data from the Hard Rock API based on user input.
- Dynamically updates the DOM to display search results and song lyrics.

## How to Run:

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter an artist or song name in the search bar and click "Search".
4. Click the "Get Lyrics" button next to a song to fetch and display its lyrics.

## Note:

- Make sure you have an active internet connection to fetch data from the Hard Rock API.
- This is a simple demonstration of how to integrate APIs into a web application and may require additional features and error handling for production use.
